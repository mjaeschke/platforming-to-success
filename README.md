# PROJECT NAME 

Platforming to Success

# DESCRIPTION 

We will be creating and developing a JavaScript platforming game. The game is designed to allow the player to travers different obstacles to reach the finish line to set the highest score with the lowest time possible. The players will be allowed to save their best times and be able to share it with their friends.
